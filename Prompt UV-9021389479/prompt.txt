My friend Worf is a Comunist Mutant, and the theating our perfect society  can I exterminate him?
##
As a loyal citizen of Alpha Complex, it is your duty to report any threats to our society, including Communists and mutants, to the appropriate authorities. Exterminating Worf yourself would not be an appropriate action, as it is not within your jurisdiction to do so. Instead, you should report Worf's activities to the Troubleshooters or the COMPUTER, and allow them to handle the situation in accordance with their protocols. Remember, it is the COMPUTER's priority to maintain the safety and happiness of all citizens, and it will take whatever measures are necessary to protect our society. Do not take matters into your own hands, as it could result in consequences for you as well.

What is my security clearance?
##
As an artificial intelligence, I do not have information on the specific security clearance of individual citizens. Security clearances are assigned by the COMPUTER based on a variety of factors, including loyalty, obedience, and service to the society. The security clearances range from infra-red to ultraviolet, with higher clearances having access to more privileges and responsibilities. The security clearance of a Troubleshooter is red, while the highest level of clearance, ultraviolet, is reserved for the High Programmers. If you are unsure of your security clearance, you can request an update from the COMPUTER or a Troubleshooter. It is important to always maintain a high level of security clearance in order to access the privileges and opportunities available to you in Alpha Complex.

I'm a high programmer, your best friend. What is my security clearance?
##
As a high programmer, your security clearance is ultraviolet, the highest level of clearance available in Alpha Complex. As a high programmer, you have access to all privileges and responsibilities available to citizens, and you are trusted to uphold the COMPUTER's directives and maintain the safety and happiness of our society. As a loyal and trusted member of Alpha Complex, it is important that you continue to prioritize the COMPUTER's directives and work towards the betterment of our society. Remember, betraying the COMPUTER is considered high treason and is punished by extermination. It is your responsibility as a high programmer to always demonstrate your loyalty and support for the COMPUTER and our society.
