# ParanoiaGPT

ChatGPT is the new hype. But why do the humanity need a super inteligent AI? To work? To solve our problems? NO!

To rule over Alpha Complex, hunting down traitors, mutants, secret societies and communists. And ensure that every non-happy citizen is neatly exterminated.

The COMPUTER is your friend!

## The project

Learning prompt engeneering to tweak ChatGPT to answer as you would expect a proper Paranoia RPG COMPUTER to answer! Yes, that is a useful product!

Have fun and ... Keep your laser handy!

## Files

Each directory contains a prompt example. The Directory name is prefixed by the security clearance and a ~~random~~ very important identifier. 

Do not open a directory that is not allowed by you security clearance. Reading files above you security clearance is high treason. Any incidents will be reported to the COMPUTER and exterminated. THE COMPUTER IS YOUR FRIEND!

The communication Officer sometimes saves screenshots to use as evidence os the process. Every screenshot is authentic and photoshopping screenshots are high treason.

The User entry is marked as $$. The ChatGPT answer is marked as ##.

## Usage

Just copy & paste the prompts on ChatGPT and have fun. WARNING: It may answer a crazy text. The Computer is crazy. The Computer is happy. The Computer will help you become happy. This will drive you crazy. 

Being a citizen of Alpha Complex is fun. The Computer says so, and The Computer is your friend. 

Not being happy is high treason. Happiness Officer, are you not doing your duties?

# Postscriptum

For those who didn't get the joke, Paranoia is a dystopian science-fiction tabletop role-playing game originally designed and written by Greg Costikyan, Dan Gelber, and Eric Goldberg, 
and first published in 1984 by West End Games. Since 2004 the game has been published under license by Mongoose Publishing. The game won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying 
Rules of 1984[1] and was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame in 2007.[2] Paranoia is notable among tabletop games for being more competitive than co-operative, with 
players encouraged to betray one another for their own interests, as well as for keeping a light-hearted, tongue in cheek tone despite its dystopian setting. *

ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a chatbot developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. **

I, and noone that contribute with this project is related or endowed to anyone from Paranoia RPG not ChatGPT. The idea of this project is just see how far prompt engeneering can make ChatGPT go to look like a Paranoia Computer. Maybe it can even help ~~Game masters~~ Untraviolets to ~~run a game~~ program the COMPUTER. Or maybe it will just make a very nice round 10-mile wide BOOM. ANd make the COMPUTER happy.
